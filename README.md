This repository contains a simple JavaScript calculator function that demonstrates an uncommon error: improper handling of the modulo operator. The `operate` function handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division correctly, but it lacks support for the modulo operator. This leads to an error when the modulo operator is used. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that handles the modulo operator gracefully.
